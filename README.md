# ecg-analysis

The (hopefully) final iteration of my R shiny app for analysis of
(crustacean) ECG data, using the Rhino framework.

Developed as part of my coursework for an intro to data science course
at university, as well as a way for me to learn about more advanced
R/programming techniques and how to optimize the code I write.

Some of the features of this app include: Uploading and
transforming/exploring your data, applying various types of filters
(e.g. FIR or Wavelet-Transform) for smoothing the data, R-Peak
detection, and more.
